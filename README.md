# {Tech: Berlin} Hackathon-2025
Team: AutoLog

We build autonomous system for logistics. Logistics and shipping companies manage thousands of forms daily, including custom declarations, import/export form, etc. In many cases, these forms are filled manually, which is error-prone and time-consuming.

Our solution is to build an autonomous system that can fill these forms automatically.

To run the code, install the following packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run the agent.py file.
```
python agent.py
```
